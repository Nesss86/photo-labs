# Photolabs

PhotoLabs is a dynamic web application built with React that allows users to explore, share, and interact with stunning photography. This project showcases my ability to build modern, responsive, and visually engaging user interfaces while leveraging Reactâ€™s component-based architecture to create a seamless user experience.

### Key Features:
#### Interactive Photo Gallery: Browse a curated collection of user-submitted photos with detailed metadata, including location and photographer profiles.

#### Responsive Design: Optimized for all screen sizes to provide an excellent experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### Dynamic Data Management: Efficiently handles user data and photos using state management and API integration with axios.

#### Custom Styling: Designed using SCSS to demonstrate advanced CSS techniques, including pseudo-elements and hover effects.

#### Testing: Tested with industry-standard tools (@testing-library/react) to ensure reliability and a bug-free experience.

This project highlights my expertise in React, SCSS, and building user-centric applications, demonstrating my ability to deliver high-quality solutions in modern web development.
